# world-weather-analysis
In this analysis a web API was used to retrieve weather data. This data was used for the PlanMyTrip app which allows customers to search for travel destinations based on weather preferences. The identified destinations are then used to find nearby hotels. A travel itinerary to multiple locations can created and with the Google Maps Directions API a travel route is generated.
